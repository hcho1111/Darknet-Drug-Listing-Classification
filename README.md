# Darknet-Drug-Listing-Classification

This project utilized NLP techniques to automatically classify whether product listings are narcotics. I tested three machine learning algorithms with varying results. 

The data was taken from the "grams" dataset, which can be found at https://www.gwern.net/DNM-archives.

Included is R code, selected data, figures, and a final writeup.
